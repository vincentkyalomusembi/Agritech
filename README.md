🌾 Agritech AI — Hack Night Demo

🔍 Overview

Agritech AI is a lightweight, AI-powered agricultural assistant accessible through USSD, making it usable by farmers with or without smartphones.
It provides crop and livestock recommendations based on region, soil type, and weather using mock AI data.
This demo is designed for hackathons, runs fully offline with mock data, and can easily integrate live APIs later.

🧠 Key Features

🌍 Works on USSD — no internet or smartphone needed.

🤖 AI-like logic using mock data (expandable to real ML model).

🌦️ Optional Weather API integration.

💬 Real-time interaction using Africa’s Talking USSD API.

🪶 Lightweight and fast — ideal for a hack night prototype.

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Agritech_ai_demo.git
cd Agritech_ai_demo

2️⃣ Create and Activate Virtual Environment

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use venv\Scripts\activate

3️⃣ Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

4️⃣ Add Environment Variables

Create a .env file:

AT_API_KEY=your_africastalking_api_key
AT_USERNAME=sandbox
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_api_key   # optional

5️⃣ Run the Server

uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8000

6️⃣ Expose with Ngrok

ngrok http 8000

Copy the Forwarding URL (e.g., https://xxxx.ngrok-free.app).

🧩 Mock Data Example (mock_data.json)

{
  "regions": {
    "Meru": {
      "soil": "loamy",
      "weather": "mild",
      "recommendation": "Beans, maize, or poultry."
    },
    "Nakuru": {
      "soil": "clay",
      "weather": "cool",
      "recommendation": "Potatoes, dairy cattle."
    },
    "Machakos": {
      "soil": "sandy",
      "weather": "hot",
      "recommendation": "Goats and drought-resistant crops like millet."
    }
  }
}

You can easily extend this file with more regions or dynamic predictions.


---

🧠 AI Logic (Optional Enhancement)

You can integrate a simple Decision Tree model or logic like:

def ai_recommendation(soil, weather):
    if soil == "loamy" and weather == "mild":
        return "Beans or poultry"
    elif soil == "clay":
        return "Potatoes or dairy"
    else:
        return "Goats or millet"
